I've been falling behind with my assignments all this month. There has been a lot going on in my personal life such as a new job, moving, the holidays, etc. so I'm having a hard time keeping up with the schedule I had set for myself which was 20 lessons a week. The amount I have completed in December has been way below that. I think what has caused me to slack off a bit is that I code at work, so I'm a little less enthusiastic about coming home and having to code 10 lessons worth of assignments and honestly, I'm a bit bored and tired of Ruby and would like to move on to JavaScript or at least build a complete project using what I've learned so far. 

However, I'm glad I started the Ruby lessons before I enrolled in Flatiron which has given me a bit of leeway. Based on my calculations, I should still be able to complete the course by next summer and no later than next fall. I just need to pick up the pace and become remotivated.
