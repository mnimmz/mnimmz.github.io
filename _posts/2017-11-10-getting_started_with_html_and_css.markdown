HTML & CSS are two languages I believe anyone who is interested in Web Development should get begin with. They are much either to process than, say a programming language such as JavaScript. When I started learning HTML & CSS, I experimented with so many different courses like Skillcrush, Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, the Odin Project, Udemy courses and many others. The HTML and CSS sections on the Learn platform are very hands-on and cover the basic skills you'll need for Front-End Development. However, if you need a little extra practice with HTML and CSS concepts, here are three courses I highly recommend:  


**1 | CODECADEMY**

This is a site that most people start off with because it's perfect for complete beginners who are just learning HTML & CSS. There are no videos, but each lesson includes short paragraphs to read through and a lesson to complete. Most likely, once you get through the HTML and CSS sections, you'll get bored with Codecademy (at least I did), so I would suggest when you get to that point, replicate any of the sites you had created on Codecademy's platform, from scratch on your own so you can practice without having to follow along with the course. Codecademy is completely free and there is no need to set up anything on your computer, as it has its own built-in text editor.

**2 | FREE CODE CAMP**

FCC is one of *the* best FREE online platforms to learn web development. The course is very extensive and covers front-end & back-end development. Its structure is like Codecademy where you do everything in your web browser and there are no videos, but the lessons are short and easy to understand. When you complete the entire course, FCC gives you the option to pair with another camper and work on a website for a non-profit organization. 

**3 | TREEHOUSE**

Teamtreehouse.com is a paid platform but it's excellent for those who are beginner and intermediate level students. Personally, I felt the lessons were a bit too slow, but I started using Treehouse when I already utilized the previous resources I mentioned. Each lesson includes a video lecture and has a built-in text editor, so once again, no need to download anything.

**BONUS | HTML & CSS: DESIGN AND BUILD WEBSITES BY JON DUCKETT**

I decided to throw in another resource for those who prefer books over online courses. HTML & CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett is perfect for visual learners, especially those who have a background in design. It's probably the most beautiful web development book you'll ever come across. There are nice pictures, short paragraphs and it's very well structured. In fact, I'd say you should pair this book with Codecademy when you're just getting started learning HTML and CSS.
